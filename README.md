# Hi, I’m Yi-Ying 👋

Frontend-focused Developer based in the UK  
React • JavaScript • Thoughtful UI • Calm, maintainable code

I enjoy building user interfaces that are clear, accessible, and easy to evolve.
My background is full-stack, but my current focus is **React and frontend architecture** —
with a solid understanding of how data, APIs, and databases fit underneath.

## 🧩 What I’m working with now
**Frontend**
- React (primary)
- JavaScript / TypeScript
- HTML, CSS (mobile-first, component-based)
- Modern tooling (Vite, Git, GitHub)

**Supporting knowledge**
- Node.js & Express (API design, data flow)
- SQL & NoSQL databases
- Basic testing (Jest, Cypress)
- Deployment & CI fundamentals

---
## 🌱 Currently focusing on
- Deepening React patterns & refactoring skills
- Writing cleaner, more expressive CSS
- Learning additional CSS frameworks intentionally (not collecting)

---

## 💬 A bit about how I work
- I value clarity over cleverness
- I refactor often and learn by revisiting old code
- I prefer steady progress to rushing features
